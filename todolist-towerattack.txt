To-Do for Tower Attack:

CODE:
    -draw path for creatures (interacting with game)
        turn off road editing
        use grid simplifaction ("tileSize") to turn mouse coordinates into grid coordinates
        using onclick function...? to fill in path array of points that will then be used to guide creatures
        "if" current tile is NOT a road, do nothing
        "if" no path on map, then start path drawing at current tile
        "if" current tile is same as previous tile, delete current (makes 2nd previous into previous automatically)
            OR deletes path completely
        "if" previous tile is previous path then add current tile as next path point

    -"start" button for creatures to follow path (interacting with game)
    -place cities, mines, etc. on roads (creating map)
    -place decorative items off roads (creating map)
    -code for each level map (lvl 1, lvl 2, lvl 3) to be selected using "world" map
    -card area layout and card creation (divs, clickable, placing graphics on each card, animating cards, etc.)
    -staging area for creatures (divs, clickable, choosing order and timing)
    -"pause" button?

ART:
    -cities (healthy, 2/3, 1/3, dead)
    -mines
    -"igloos" starting/end points for creatures
    -city weapons: fast turrets (laser?), high damage turrets (projectile?)
    -animal sprites: penguin, snake, spider, sheep, cardinal
    -card graphics:
        animals (same as sprites),
        buffs (speed, armor, health),
        numerals (or maybe just use text...?),
        "calories" (pizza?)
    -"world" map to choose levels
